# lavaanPlot 0.3.0

* Added support for latent variables (denoted by circles) in plots

* Added support for edge labels with significant coefficients

# lavaanPlot 0.4.0

* Added support for latent variable loading labels

* Added support for covariance edges

* Corrected the direction of arrows for latent variable loadings

# lavaanPlot 0.5.0

* Added support for covariance edge labels

* Added support for significance stars

# lavaanPlot 0.5.1

* Fixed bug caused by . in variable names

* simplified the functions using the ... argument

* fixed significance stars to work with standardized and non-standardized coefficients

* Changed significance stars so you can choose which parameters to use them with

# lavaanPlot 0.5.2

* Added digits option for coefficients

* Changed coefs argument behavior so that it toggles coef values for covariances too

* Plots now show residual covariances
